# 01. Project Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

Many medium-scale furniture boutiques still depend on traditional physical showroom operations, manual inventory tracking, spreadsheets, and disconnected order management processes. These approaches create operational challenges such as inaccurate stock information, inefficient order processing, limited customer engagement, and reduced visibility into business activities.

The **Ruqi Store** is a premium web-based furniture e-commerce platform designed to digitize and improve the core operations of a furniture retail business. The system provides an integrated solution for online product browsing, customer account management, shopping cart operations, wishlist management, order processing, inventory tracking, and showroom appointment scheduling.

The platform aims to provide customers with a seamless digital shopping experience while enabling store management to efficiently control products, orders, inventory, and customer interactions through a centralized system.

The system is designed using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQL Server**, following a structured software analysis and design approach throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional furniture retail operations face several limitations due to dependence on manual processes:

- Inventory information may become inaccurate because stock updates are performed manually.
- Customers have limited ability to explore products and available options remotely.
- Order processing requires additional staff effort and increases the possibility of errors.
- Product price changes may create difficulties when maintaining accurate historical order information.
- Store management lacks a centralized platform for monitoring products, orders, and customer activities.

These challenges reduce operational efficiency and affect the overall customer shopping experience.

The Ruqi Store system addresses these problems by providing a centralized digital platform that connects customers, products, inventory, orders, and showroom services in one integrated solution.
